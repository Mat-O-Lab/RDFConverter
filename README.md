Conversion and validation of YARRRML and Chowlk files to RDF

Input (A json file containing): 
•	yarrrml file (https://github.com/Mat-O-Lab/resources/blob/main/mappings/Zugversuch_eng_ETFE-Ref%252BGroesseneffekt2-map.yaml)
•	RDF Method generated by Chowlk
•	SHACL shapes
 
Output: RDF

The RDF content should be validated according to the constraints defined on the SHACL Shapes.
The RDF content that should be validated is the content from the YARRRML file because it contains instances.
The validation will not occur on the RDF content from CHOWLk, because it does not contain instances to be validated.

It will be a java service on the web, to be deployed with tom-cat or another java servlet container.

To call the service you use:

http://localhost:8080/rdfconv/conv?jsonfile=http://myjsonfile.json
